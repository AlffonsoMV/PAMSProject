## Context
This repository contains the final project for the Paris Applied Mathematics Semester at École des Ponts ParisTech during the Fall 2023 semester. The project has been developed under the supervision of PhD. Noé Blassel. 

## Introduction
This thesis delves into several sophisticated statistical and computational techniques, focusing on the simulation of random variables, exploration of Hamiltonian dynamics, and an in-depth study of Markov chains. Each section provides a blend of theoretical understanding and practical application.

## Sections

### 1. Simulation of Random Variables
This section delves into the techniques for simulating random variables and validating statistical laws.
- **1.1 Inverse CDF Method**: Discusses the simulation of random variables using the inverse cumulative distribution function.
- **1.2 Rejection Sampling Method**: Explores the rejection sampling method, including detailed sub-sections on the selection of enveloping distributions and method results.
- **1.3 Empirical Validation of Important Statistical Laws**: Covers the empirical validation of the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem.
- **1.4 Variance Reduction Techniques**: Explores various techniques for reducing variance in simulations, including control variates, importance sampling, stratified sampling, antithetic variates, and a comparative review.

### 2. Hamiltonian Dynamics
This section addresses the fundamentals and applications of Hamiltonian dynamics.
- **2.1 Introduction to Hamiltonian Dynamics**: Provides an overview of Hamiltonian dynamics.
- **2.2 Symplectic Schemes**: Details various symplectic schemes including the Euler method, the construction of symplectic schemes, and the symplectic Euler method, with a focus on linear stability analysis.
- **2.3 Solar System Simulation**: Applies Hamiltonian dynamics to simulate the solar system, discussing gravitational dynamics, the Störmer-Verlet scheme, and various implementation experiments.

### 3. Markov Chains and Their Applications
Focuses on Markov Chains and their applications in different contexts.
- **3.1 Introduction to Markov Chains**: Introduces Markov Chains, discussing stationary distributions, irreducibility, and uniqueness.
