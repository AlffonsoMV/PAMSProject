## Introduction
This thesis delves into several sophisticated statistical and computational techniques, focusing on the simulation of random variables, exploration of Hamiltonian dynamics, and an in-depth study of Markov chains. Each section provides a blend of theoretical understanding and practical application.

## Sections

### Simulation of Random Variables

- **Rejection Sampling Method**: Detailed exploration of rejection sampling, including the selection of enveloping distributions and method results.
- **Empirical Validation**: Methods to validate the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem through empirical approaches.
- **Variance Reduction Techniques**: Discusses various techniques like control variates, importance sampling, stratified sampling, and antithetic variates, and compares their effectiveness.

### 2. Hamiltonian Dynamics
- **Introduction and Symplectic Schemes**: Covers the fundamentals of Hamiltonian dynamics and the development of symplectic schemes.
- **Numerical Methods**: Analysis of various numerical methods including the Euler method, and the construction of symplectic schemes.
- **Stability Analysis**: Linear stability analysis of the Symplectic Euler and Verlet Schemes.
- **Solar System Simulation**: Implementing the learned techniques to model and simulate gravitational dynamics in the solar system, with a focus on the Stormer-Verlet scheme.

### 3. Markov Chains
- **Fundamentals of Markov Chains**: Introduction to Markov Chains, covering stationary distributions and the principles of irreducibility and uniqueness.
- **Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods**: Detailed exploration of the Metropolis-Hastings and Gibbs Sampling algorithms, with practical examples like sampling from Gamma and Bivariate Normal distributions.
